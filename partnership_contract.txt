[Partnership Contract]

Please write your name and your partner's name below:

Partner 1: [YOUR NAME]
Partner 2: [YOUR PARTNER'S NAME]

1. I shall do my fair share of work for all group work.  I understand that I
may receive a different score from my partner upon adjudication, if a complaint
is filed by my partner on that matter.  I understand that git repository commit
history is an indication of my contribution to the group.

2. I shall notify my partner on termination of partnership as soon as possible
and no later than 2 days after project release (partnership initiation is
allowed at any time up to the deadline).  I shall also immediately resubmit my
new contract to courseweb on change of partnership status.

3. I shall communicate with my partner on the division of work within 1 week
of project release, or immediately on group formation if I form the group
after 1 week has already passed.

4. I shall respond to my partner's emails within 24 hours, bar an emergency.

Please copy this document and submit on courseweb under Course Documents where
you will find Partnership Contract.  Please submit using the Text Submission
functionality.  Submitting this document on courseweb will bind you to this
contract, effective on the date of submission.
