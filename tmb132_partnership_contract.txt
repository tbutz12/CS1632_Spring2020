[Partnership Contract]

Please write your name and your partner's name below:

Partner 1: Tristin Butz
Partner 2: Adam Nash

1. I shall do my fair share of work for all group work.  I understand that I
may receive a different score from my partner upon adjudication, if a complaint
is filed by my partner on that matter.  I understand that git repository commit
history is an indication of my contribution to the group.

2. I shall notify my partner on termination of partnership as soon as possible
and no later than 2 days after project release (partnership initiation is
allowed at any time up to the deadline).  I shall also immediately resubmit my
new contract to courseweb on change of partnership status.

3. I shall communicate with my partner on the division of work within 1 week
of project release, or immediately on group formation if I form the group
after 1 week has already passed.

4. I shall respond to my partner's emails within 24 hours, bar an emergency.

Please copy this document and submit on courseweb under Course Documents where
